EXP-06: Implement the AI random movement.
Date:24/4/25
Aim
To implement an AI character in Unreal Engine that roams randomly within a defined area using Behavior Trees and Navigation Mesh.

Procedure
Navigation Setup

Add a NavMeshBoundsVolume to your level and scale it to cover the roamable area.
Ensure navigation is built (press P to visualize the navmesh).
Create AI Character

Create a new Character or Pawn Blueprint (e.g., BP_AICharacter).
Add an AIController Blueprint (e.g., BP_AIController) and assign it to your AI character.
Set Up Behavior Tree

Create a Behavior Tree (e.g., BT_RandomRoam) and a corresponding Blackboard.
Add a Blackboard Key (e.g., TargetLocation) of type Vector.
Implement Roaming Logic

In the Behavior Tree, use the following structure:
Root ‚ûù Selector
Sequence
Find Random Location (custom task to set TargetLocation)
Move To node (uses TargetLocation)
Create a custom BTTask Blueprint for finding a random location using UNavigationSystemV1::GetRandomPointInNavigableRadius.
Place and Test

Place your AI character in the level.
Assign the AI Controller and Behavior Tree.
Play the scene and observe the AI roaming randomly.

Result
The AI character successfully roams within the defined NavMesh area, choosing random destinations at intervals using the Behavior Tree logic.
